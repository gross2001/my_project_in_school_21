01_gnl - I wrote a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor. \
02_printf - I recoded printf from standart library. \
03_push_swap - This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, I manipulated various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.\
04_pipex - This project aims to make me understand a bit deeper two concepts: the redirections and the pipes. \
05_so_long - This project is a small 2D game with minilibx. \
06_philo - I learnt the basics of threading a process, how to make threads and the mutex. \
07_minishell - I created a simple shell with my teammate. It's something like little bash or zsh. I learnt a lot about processes and file descriptors. \
